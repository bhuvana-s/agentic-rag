Rainier 7.5km Trail\n   - by Bhuvaneswari Subramani\n\nThere's something incredibly invigorating about being surrounded by nature, especially when it involves mountains, snow, waterfalls, and a challenging hike. This love for nature brought me to the renowned Mt. Rainier 7.5km Trail, a journey that promised breathtaking views and an unforgettable experience. Here's a detailed account of my adventurous trek on this iconic trail and a big thanks to fellow AWS Heroes who made it possible for me!!\n\nPreparation and Excitement\nThe anticipation of exploring Mt. Rainier was electrifying.

I relied on our fellow AWS Hero, Richard Fan, who meticulously planned everything. As a first-time hiker, I wanted to experience the total surprise element.\n\nArmed with all the necessary gear and a spirit ready for adventure, I arrived at the hiking station at 2:00 PM, refreshed and eager to embark on this thrilling journey.\n\nThe Beauty of the Trail\nAs we began the hike, the first thing that struck me was the sheer beauty of the surroundings. The trail was flanked by dense forests, the air was crisp, and the sound of birds chirping added a melodic backdrop to the adventure.\n\nOvercoming the First Challenge\nThe first 500 meters proved to be a big challenge. My legs felt heavy, and my entire body seemed five times heavier with each step. For a moment, I questioned if I had made the right decision or if I was risking my life. I didn't want to spoil the joy of my fellow hikers, but Brian and Richard reassured me that we could take it slowly and finish together. They even offered to carry my water bottle and snacks to lighten my load. Meanwhile the 4 ambitious hikers Ana, Angela, Lyndon, and Tomasz sped ahead, aiming for a longer trail, while Richard, Brian, and I chose the smaller one.\n\nFinding Strength in Small Gestures\nSipping water made me dizzy, and I worried about fainting. Thankfully, a friend's suggestion to carry chocolates saved the day. After eating one, I felt much better and started navigating the trail slowly.\n\nReflecting on Past Experiences\nThe first 1.2 km was a struggle, filled with self-doubt. Memories of my National Cadet Corps days, trekking from Mettupalayam to Ooty in Tamil Nadu, came flooding back. Despite representing Coimbatore district in ball badminton and keeping up with daily walking and yoga, I hadn\u2019t tackled such a physically demanding activity in years. The only exceptions were the 30,000 steps a day at AWS re:Invent and the occasional uphill climbs to my favorite Lord Subramanya or walking to Lord Siva temples.\n\nInspiration from Fellow Hikers\nSeeing a lady in her 60s descending the trail slowly was a big motivation. I stopped by her to ask her experience. She had started at 9:30 AM all alone, walked steadily, and was now nearing the end. Her determination inspired me to keep going.\nI observed numerous children, aged 6 and older, happily bouncing around as their parents hurried along the hike. I was especially impressed by two fathers who carried their infants in suitable baby slings during the hike.\n\nMotivating Myself\nSeveral thoughts crossed my mind, but self-talk kept me going. \"Bhuvana, this is your first hike.

Richard provided live commentary about our progress and guided us on the route by tracing the map. We walked together slowly and steadily. Walking on the snow was a bit scary because neither of us had a trekking pole or trekking boots, but we managed to push forward.\n\nThe steeper section\nAs we progressed further, the trail became steeper and more challenging. The elevation gain was noticeable, and with it came patches of snow.\n\nReaching the Summit\nAfter hours of trekking, we finally reached the summit. The panoramic view from the top was nothing short of spectacular. I could see the sprawling landscapes, distant peaks, and the beautiful horizon. It was a moment of pure exhilaration and accomplishment. we spent some time at the summit, reflecting on the journey and enjoying the serene beauty around us.\n\nA Magical Wildlife Adventure: From Deer to Mermaids\nDuring our visit, we were thrilled to spot deer near the visitor center. As we continued our journey, we encountered a wild white goat and even a mermaid, which was quite a surprise! At the top, we were delighted to see squirrels scampering around. Each of these sightings brought us fresh waves of joy and excitement.\n\nThe Descent\nThe descent was equally challenging but in a different way. Navigating down the steep, snow-covered sections required caution and steady footing. However, the journey back allowed me to see the trail from a different perspective, appreciating the same landscapes in a new light.\n\nThe contrast between the lush green forests, the vibrant green landscape, and the pristine white snow was mesmerizing. The trail required careful navigation, especially on the snowy sections, but the views made every step worthwhile. The flowers of white, pink, and yellow were stunning, adding a splash of color to the landscape. The majestic mountains in the background added to the beauty, creating a breathtaking panorama.\n\n(As a lover of flowers and nature, this is the most beautiful picture I cherished throughout the hike.)\n\nThe descent was relatively quicker, but it still required energy and focus.\n\nMost importantly, at every key point, paused to take in the breathtaking views of snow-covered mountains, lush green landscapes, and vibrant flowers!\n\nEncountering the Waterfalls\nOne of the highlights of the Mt. Rainier 7.5 Trail is the series of waterfalls that greet you along the way. The sight and sound of cascading water were both soothing and invigorating. I took a moment at each waterfall to appreciate the natural beauty and capture some photos. These stops were perfect for rehydrating and taking short breaks to soak in the scenery.\nHere is the waterfall that cascades gracefully, surrounded by lush greenery and the soothing sounds of nature, creating a serene and breathtaking scene.\n\nAll good things come to an end!!\nAs we approach the visitor center, retracing our steps from the start of our journey, the stunning sunset greets us warmly. Ana, Angela, Lyndon, and Tomasz, who arrived earlier, joined us for a group photo at the base of the majestic scenery.\n\nConclusion\nThe Mt. Rainier 7.5km Trail is a trek that I will always cherish. It combined all the elements of nature that I love \u2013 mountains, snow, waterfalls, and a challenging hike.
